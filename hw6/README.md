The majority of code for this homework is located in `hw6.ipynb`, with
the exception of some helper functions, which are located in
`util.py`.

Running the entire `hw6.ipynb` will load the airport data from file,
create the database, download the weather data and save it into the
database, run analyses on the data, and produce plots.
