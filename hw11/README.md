All of the code for this week is in the `batting-averages.ipynb`
IPython notebook, which explicitly goes through each part of the
homework to compute estimates of player batting averages using both
maximum likelihood (MLE) and a full Bayesian posterior (from a
Beta-Binomial model). All plots are generated inline.
